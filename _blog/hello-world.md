Hi. Welcome to my homepage. 

This website is created using Next.js and deployed on Vercel, which in turn is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). I am writing this from my computer in Seattle, WA. The computer that is loading this page on your phone or laptop or desktop lives in one of [these cities](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/regions#region-list). 

This entire website was overkill and I wouldn't do this again.
